      <p>Python is a general purpose programming language which is dynamically typed, interpreted, and known for its easy readability with great design principles.
      </p>
      <p>it  is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language.Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.

    <header>Where we can use Python</header>
     <p>
     Python can easily be used for small, large, online and offline projects. The best options for utilizing Python are web development, simple scripting and data analysis. Below are a few examples of what Python will let you do

  <section class="main-section" id="Web_development">
          <header>Web development</header>
          <p>You can use Python to create web applications on many levels of complexity. There are many excellent Python web frameworks, including Pyramid, Django and Flask, to name a few.

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_analysis">
      <header>Data analysis</header>
      <p>Python is the leading language of choice for many data scientists. Python has grown in popularity within the field due to the availability of many excellent libraries focused on data science (of which NumPy and Pandas are two of the most well-known) and data visualisation (like Matplotlib and Seaborn). Pyton really made Data crunching fun with all its numerous available libraries. Ipython with JupyterLab is another form of Python that improves the usage of Python in the field of data science.

            <header>Automation</header>
            <p>
Python is a very flexible language that can be used to automate boring or repetitive tasks. System administrators often use it by writing scripts which can be easily executed from the terminal. Python can also be used to create bots which automate some of our daily tasks.

            <p>
Python is also used extensively in the growing field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Google selected Python to be one of the first well-supported programming languages for training and interacting with models using Tensorflow.

            <p>
Python is used to build Networking tools and security-tools that are widely used. Python’s remote automation is the most secure, fast and efficient for cloud-testing of frameworks. That’s why professional developers use python for making the most secure frameworks and for socket-programming.

            <p>
Python is one of the best languages suited for machine learning, deep learning and data analytics with a stronghold in all of them.

There are specialized languages best suited for various role such as R and MATLAB, but when it comes to overlapping fields of applications python wins hands down due to its flexibility and rapid prototyping and availability of libraries.

            <p>
Python can also be used to parse pages' source codes and retrieve its data. Using some python modules, such as Scrapy and also (for some pages which use javascript) Selenium should do the trick!

Python language is more expressive means that it is more understandable and readable.
        <li>Interpreted Language</li>
Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time. This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.
        <li>Cross-platform Language</li>
Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.
        <li>Free and Open Source</li>
Python language is freely available at offical web address.The source-code is also available. Therefore it is open source.

Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.
        <li>Extensible</li>
It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our python code.
        <li> Large Standard Library</li>
Python has a large and broad library and prvides rich set of module and functions for rapid application development.
        <li>GUI Programming Support</li>
Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.
        <li>Integrated</li>
It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc.
